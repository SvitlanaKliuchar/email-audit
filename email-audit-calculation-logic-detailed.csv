EDGE CASE: Validation Warning Triggered,,,,,
Step,Component,Condition,Example,Action,Result
D1,Check Revenue per Subscriber,If revenue/list > $50,100000 / 500 = $200/sub,Trigger warning,Yellow banner appears
D2,Warning Message,"Revenue per subscriber seems unusually high. Please verify.",Shows in banner,User sees warning,Prompts data review
D3,Continue Calculation,Doesn't block calculation,Still calculates opportunity,Shows estimate,Non-blocking validation
D4,Recommendation to User,Review data before client presentation,Check for data entry errors,Catch mistakes early,Quality assurance

CONFIDENCE LEVEL DETERMINATION LOGIC,,,,,
Condition,List Size,Revenue Provided,Confidence Level,Multiplier,Badge Color
Both strong data,>1000,Yes,High,1.0 (no reduction),Green
Revenue only,<1000,Yes,Medium,0.85 (15% reduction),Yellow

Automations,2-3/4 automations,15%,Missing some - moderate impact,Medium,"Complete remaining automation flows"
Automations,4/4 automations,0%,Nothing missing,N/A,No recommendation
Consistency,0/1 weekly emails,25%,Critical foundation missing,1st or 2nd,"Start weekly email campaigns"
Consistency,1/1 weekly emails,0%,Has consistency,N/A,No recommendation

Advanced,3-6/7 list tactics,8%,Room for advanced tactics,4th or 5th,"Add QR codes and social automation"
Advanced,0-2 or 7/7,0%,Too early or complete,N/A,No recommendation

SAFETY CAPS DECISION LOGIC,,,,,
Cap Type,Formula,Threshold,Reason,Example ($100k revenue),Example (10k list)
Revenue-Based Cap,opportunity < revenue × 0.50,50% of current revenue,No single initiative doubles business,Opportunity capped at $50k,N/A
List-Based Cap,opportunity < listSize × 5,$5 per subscriber/month,Extremely high bar,N/A,Opportunity capped at $50k
Combined Check,Apply whichever is relevant,Use revenue cap if revenue provided; else list cap,Prevents any absurd projections,Uses revenue cap,Uses list cap
No Cap Scenario,Very low revenue or small list,Caps may not trigger,Opportunity might be below thresholds,If opp = $5k and cap = $50k then no reduction,If opp = $3k and cap = $50k then no reduction

CURRENCY FORMATTING LOGIC,,,,,
Currency Code,Symbol,Position,Example Amount,Formatted Output,Notes
USD,$,Before,12345,"$12,345",Standard US format
GBP,£,Before,12345,"£12,345",Standard UK format
Future: EUR,€,After (varies by locale),12345,"12.345 €" or "€12,345",Not yet implemented
Future: CAD,$,Before,12345,"$12,345",Not yet implemented

CALCULATION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST,,,,,
Check,What to Verify,How to Verify,Pass Condition,Fail Condition,Action if Fail
1,Recommendations sum to total,Add all recommendation values,Sum equals opportunity within $1,Sum differs by >$1,Fix normalization logic
2,Percentages are reasonable,Review current and best-practice %,12-25% current; 25-30% best,<12% or >35%,Adjust benchmarks
3,Revenue/sub is realistic,Calculate monthly rev / list size,$0.50-$10 per subscriber,<$0.10 or >$50,Show validation warning
4,Opportunity < revenue,Check opportunity vs input revenue,Opportunity ≤ 50% of revenue,Opportunity > 50%,Apply revenue cap
5,Weights sum properly,Add all category weights,Close to 100% before normalization,Way off from 100%,Review weight logic
6,Confidence badge shows,Visual check,Badge appears with color,Badge missing,Fix UI logic
7,Currency formatting,Check for proper symbols,$ or £ appears correctly,Wrong symbol or position,Fix currency function
